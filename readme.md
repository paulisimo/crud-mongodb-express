# Simple CRUD using node.js, Express, Jade, Mongoose and Mongodb

Basic CRUD seems like the starting point for just any web app. Found there wasn't much available for node.js. So here is a first go.

INSTALLATION
Get node.js, npm and mongdb

npm install mongoose
npm install jade
npm install express

SETTING UP
Start mongodb in the terminal. Navigate to your mongodb install directory which should be something like..
/Users/Username/src/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.8.3/bin and run mongod. There are probably better ways, I don't know them.

In another terminal cd into the crud-mongo-express directory and run

node index.js

In a browser go to 

http://localhost:3000/posts/
